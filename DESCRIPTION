Description: This package implements CBEA, a method to perform set-based
    analysis for microbiome relative abundance data. This approach
    constructs a competitive balance between taxa within the set and
    remainder taxa per sample. More details can be found in the Nguyen et
    al. 2021+ manuscript. Additionally, this package adds support
    functions to help users perform taxa-set enrichment analyses using
    existing gene set analysis methods.  In the future we hope to also
    provide curated knowledge driven taxa sets.
